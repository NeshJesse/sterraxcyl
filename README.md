# üìå Notes
- [Here](https://skylens.io/blog/how-to-find-your-instagram-session-id) is a tutorial on how you can find your "__sessionid__".
- If you want to extract lists __without express mode__, __it will take a long time__. I advise to do something else while the program does the job.
- If your password contains special characters (and it should...) such as "!", you may enclose it between quotes.
- __It is better if you use an account made specially for the occasion__. __I do not recommend using your personnal account__ !
- The account you will use must have __2FA disabled__.
- If the target __account is private__, __you must be following it__ to extract data of it.
- If instagram blocks you, i recommend __using another account__.
- This program can be very powerful against most of instagram users, including big accounts: i tried it once one real account (with 250k followers), and it brought me very far. __I'm not responsible of its misuse, but don't do shit with it__.
- The program __doesn't work on GitPod__.

I will soon have no more time for coding during a certain period (because im joining army). Feel free to work on my program if you want to make it better.  
If you want to help this project, here is a "to do" list:
- Adding probabilities of interests in \_pro.py file (actually there's just probabilities of being a personnal accounts)
